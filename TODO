maybe option to limit OVERALL downloads, not just per subreddit?

better statistics

check for race conditions in RedditImageGrab

windows compatibility

maybe use multiprocessing instead of mutlithreading?

what if no internet connection?

check those exceptions

print some info about threads maybe


try to limit overall requests by implementing something similar to the
--update function
